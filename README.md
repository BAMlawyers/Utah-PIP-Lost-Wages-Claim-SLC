## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I’m self-employed?**  
Provide 1099s, business income reports, or tax returns. Your accountant may need to draft a letter verifying pre-crash income averages.

**Q: What if my employer doesn’t cooperate?**  
Document your efforts and provide wage data from other sources. You may also submit a sworn declaration.

**Q: Can I be partially disabled and still qualify?**  
Yes. You may receive prorated benefits if your injury affects hours worked or duties performed.

**Q: Can I continue to collect PIP lost wages after I start working part-time?**  
Yes, if your gross income remains reduced. Benefits are calculated against pre-crash earnings.

**Q: Is PIP taxable?**  
No. Lost wage PIP benefits are not taxed.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Missing the 3-day waiting period**: Benefits don’t begin until day 4.
- **Failing to get proper medical documentation**: A doctor must formally take you off work.
- **Submitting incomplete wage proof**: The insurer may deny or delay payment.
- **Letting your PIP limit get exhausted by medical bills**: Request split payments (medical and wage) if necessary.
